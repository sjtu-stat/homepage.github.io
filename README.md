## Getting started

### Local setup

#### Local setup using Docker (Recommended on Windows)

You need to take the following steps to get `al-folio` up and running in your local machine:

- First, install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
- Then, clone this repository to your machine:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
$ cd <your-repo-name>
```

Finally, run the following command that will pull a pre-built image from DockerHub and will run your website.

```bash
$ docker-compose up
```

Note that when you run it for the first time, it will download a docker image of size 300MB or so.

Now, feel free to customize the theme however you like (don't forget to change the name!). After you are done, you can use the same command (`docker-compose up`) to render the webpage with all you changes. Also, make sure to commit your final changes.

> To change port number, you can edit `docker-compose.yml` file.

<details><summary>(click to expand) <strong>Build your own docker image:</strong></summary>

> Note: this approach is only necessary if you would like to build an older or very custom version of al-folio.

Build and run a new docker image using:
```bash
$ docker-compose -f docker-local.yml up
```
> If you want to update jekyll, install new ruby packages, etc., all you have to do is build the image again using `--force-recreate` argument at the end of previous command! It will download ruby and jekyll and install all ruby packages again from scratch.

</details>

#### Local Setup (Standard)

Assuming you have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) installed on your system (*hint: for ease of managing ruby gems, consider using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv)*), first [fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) the repo from `github.com:LCNS-SJTU/lcns-sjtu.github.io` to `github.com:<your-username>/<your-repo-name>` and do the following:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
$ cd <your-repo-name>
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec jekyll serve --lsi
```

Now, feel free to change the forked repository however you like. After you are done, **commit** your final changes.
